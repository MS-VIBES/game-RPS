PRE-REQUISITE:-

[Random Library]
- what is library?
ANS= It is a collection of related modules. It contains bundle of codes that can be used repeatedly in different programs.
- What is the full form of PYPI?
ANS= Python package index.
- What is Random variable?
ANS= It is the built in module that you can use to make any random things (values/input/sequences) etc. It is the most used libraray in python for gaming.

***Inside library there are many methods which can be used according to the need****

- What are methods?
ANS= They are reusable piece of code that can be called/ invoked at any point in the program.
It is further of three types:- 1. Class method. 2. Static method. 3. Instance method.

- Which methods can be used in this game?
ANS= few of the most used methods are:-
1. RANDOM:-  picks up any random float number between 0 and 1.
2. SEED:-  initializes the random  no.  generator.
3. CHOICE:- Returns a random selection from a given sequence.
4. CHOICES:- Returns a list with a random slecetion from the given sequence.

- What are statements in Python?
ANS= A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. So, in simple words, we can say anything written in Python is a statement. There are mainly four types of statements in Python, print statements, Assignment statements, Conditional statements, Looping statements. The print and assignment statements are commonly used.

- Under What category if statements lie? Elaborate.
ANS= Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way.The compound statement includes the conditional and loop statement.

	*if statement: It is a control flow statement that will execute statements under it if the condition is true. Also kown as a conditional 			statement.
	*while statements: The while loop statement repeatedly executes a code block while a particular condition is true. Also known as a 					looping statement.
	*for statement: Using for loop statement, we can iterate any sequence or iterable variable. The sequence can be string, list, 			dictionary,set, or tuple. Also known as a looping statement.
	*try statement: specifies exception handlers.
			with statement: Used to cleanup code for a group of statements, while the with statement allows the execution of 			initialization and finalization code around a block of code.
- Explain If-ELif-else Statement?
ANS= The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
	The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
	A Python if statement evaluates whether a condition is equal to true or false.

- What are lists?
ANS= Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. Lists are created using square brackets. List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

-What are conditions in python?
ANS= Equals: a == b
	Not Equals: a != b
	Less than: a < b
	Less than or equal to: a <= b
	Greater than: a > b
	Greater than or equal to: a >= b
(***there are many others conditions too***)
================================================================================================================================================[LOGIC]:- 
no of cases possible while palying the game:3*3=9

COMPUTER		USER
Scissors		Scissors, Stone, Paper
Stone			Scissors, Stone, Paper
Paper			Scissors, Stone, Paper

Pattern of taking cases:
1. DRAW CASES:- 3
"stone-stone" , "paper-Paper", "scissors-Scissors"
2. Stone cases= 2
"stone-Paper", "stone-Scissors"
3. Paper cases=2
"Paper-stone", "paper-Scissors"
4. Scissors cases=2
"scissors-Stone", "scissors-Paper"
