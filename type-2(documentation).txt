						ROCK, PAPER AND SCISSORS

===============================================type-1(using if-elif-else & while loop)==========================================================

PRE-REQUISITE:-

[Random Library]
- what is library?
ANS= It is a collection of related modules. It contains bundle of codes that can be used repeatedly in different programs.

- What is the full form of PYPI?
ANS= Python package index.

- What is Random variable?
ANS= It is the built in module that you can use to make any random things (values/input/sequences) etc. It is the most used libraray in python for gaming.

***Inside library there are many methods which can be used according to the need****

- What are methods?
ANS= They are reusable piece of code that can be called/ invoked at any point in the program.
It is further of three types:- 1. Class method. 2. Static method. 3. Instance method.

- Which methods can be used in this game?
ANS= few of the most used methods are:-
1. RANDOM:-  picks up any random float number between 0 and 1.
2. SEED:-  initializes the random  no.  generator.
3. CHOICE:- Returns a random selection from a given sequence.
4. CHOICES:- Returns a list with a random slecetion from the given sequence.

- What are statements in Python?
ANS= A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. So, in simple words, we can say anything written in Python is a statement. There are mainly four types of statements in Python, print statements, Assignment statements, Conditional statements, Looping statements. The print and assignment statements are commonly used.

- Under What category if statement and while loop  lie? Elaborate.
ANS= Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way.The compound statement includes the conditional and loop statement.

	*if statement: It is a control flow statement that will execute statements under it if the condition is true. Also kown as a conditional 			statement.
	*while statements: The while loop statement repeatedly executes a code block while a particular condition is true. Also known as a 					looping statement.
	*for statement: Using for loop statement, we can iterate any sequence or iterable variable. The sequence can be string, list, 						dictionary,set, or tuple. Also known as a looping statement.
	*try statement: specifies exception handlers.
			with statement: Used to cleanup code for a group of statements, while the with statement allows the execution of 			initialization and finalization code around a block of code.

- Explain If-ELif-else Statement?
ANS= The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
	The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
	A Python if statement evaluates whether a condition is equal to true or false.

- What are lists?
ANS= Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. Lists are created using square brackets. List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

-What are conditions in python?
ANS= Equals: a == b
	Not Equals: a != b
	Less than: a < b
	Less than or equal to: a <= b
	Greater than: a > b
	Greater than or equal to: a >= b
(***there are many others conditions too***)

-What are Counter variables?
ANS= In simple words, a counter variable is a variable that keeps track of the number of times a specific piece of code is executed. The counter variable is declared and used in the same way as the normal variables are declared and used.

-What is For loop in python? Give its syntax.
ANS= A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

EXAMPLE:- fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
		   for x in fruits:
  			print(x)
-What is range function?
ANS= To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

EXAMPLE:- for x in range(6):
  		print(x)
***Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.***

-What are functions in python?
ANS= A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.

-What is While loop in python?
ANS= With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
	With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.
	With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

-What is While true loop in python?
ANS= The "while true" loop in python runs without any conditions until the break statement executes inside the loop. To run a statement if a python while loop fails, the programmer can implement a python "while" with else loop.

-What does "\n" and "\t" means?
ANS= In Python strings, the backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: "\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return.

-What are operators in python?
ANS= Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
	Python divides the operators in the following groups:

		Arithmetic operators
		Assignment operators
		Comparison operators
		Logical operators
		Identity operators
		Membership operators
		Bitwise operators
================================================================================================================================================[OUTPUT NEEDED]:- 

hello...! welcome to the game ------------->A.

CHOICES:- 
1. Stone
2. Paper
3. Scissors------------------------------->B.
Choose your options:- 

(For example:- ) Stone vs Scissors-------->C.

		HUMAN WINS---------------->D.

Human Score:- 1 		Computer Score:- 0--------->E.

Chances left:- 4----------------------------------------->F

(-----repeat the above game 5 times)------>G.

At the end :- 

Concluding statement as "human beats computer by:-2"------>H.

[LOGIC APPLIED IN THE OUTPUT]

A. use print statement.
B. Again use print statement and n string to add the text in next line whenever necessary. use if else statement and while loop to code the logic of game.  Ask for the input as human 
C. Give the output as human VS Computer by initializing the human and computer.
D. give the result by storing it into a new empty variable result and make it print at the end.
E.Start the counters of human and computer score board and make it increase accordingly .
F. Also start the reverse counter of chances and make it decrease accordingly after every chance.
G. in order to repeat the game 5 times it must lie in for loop.with range 0 to 5.
H.Add yet another if-elif-else condition to specify what to print if computer wins, human wins or the match comes out to be draw using operators.
