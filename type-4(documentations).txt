10...Making the functions and then connecting them.======> choice_update(a)
 function A:- Function for message display ====> msg_update.
 function B:-  function for computer score update, this will be connected to Computer_score_update===> computer_update.
 function C:- function for player score update , this will be connected to player_score_board========> player_score_update.
 function D:- function for deciding the result (p as player, c as computer), this is the main logic. it has further 4 cases possible which intern are divided into 2cases.  case no - 1/4 I. p==c: (tie)===> call A. 
				  case no- 2/4 II. p==rock :- (has further 2 cases) (i) c==paper ===> call A (computer wins), call B for +1
				   (ii) c==scissors ===> call A (player wins), call C for +1
similaly other two cases will be made .

 function E:- connecting image to choices. 
      choices has further two parts-----> I. player(a) a==rock, this will display rock2 images i.e calls label_player and same for the other 2.
